        Hello, my name is Julian Mireles, and I am taking this course to learn a new skill. Apart from learning a new skill, I wish to get really good at this and get a career and provide a better life for my family.

        Upon getting experience in this skill and career, I want to eventually start my own business. I hope to use the skills learned and obtained to develop a successful business. My goal is to use this skill to start an Indoor Sports Complex Arena. By using these skills I will be able to design a killer website.
