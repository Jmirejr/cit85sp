    <h1>Vegeta: The Prince of all Saiyans</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            Born in the now extinct planet of Vegeta, his father was King Vegeta. His planet was destroyed by the space tyrant, Lord Frieza.
        </p>
        <p class="2">
            Vegeta is the known Prince of all Saiyans. He is at the moment the rightful heir to the throne.
        </p>
        <p class="3">
            Although he may be the heir to the throne, he is not the strongest saiyan in existence. That title falls to Goku.
        </p>
        <p class="4">
            Goku is the strongest there is but he wants no part in any throne, he just wants to fight strong foes.

            In my personal opinion, I think Vegeta is the best character in the the Dragonball univerese. He had the most character development in the series. He went from villain to anti-hero, to me he shows the most human side out of all characters.
