            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>Gaming is who I am, it is a part of me. I grew up playing video games. Gaming has been accused of causing violence and brainwashing. In my case, gaming has been a way to escape to a different reality. I have had moments in my life where things were tough for me, and video games allowed me to release stress and in the process create great friendships.</p>
    
            <h3>Gaming against Depression and Anxiety</h3>
            <p>Gaming has been linked to helping fight depression and anxiety issues. I can only speak from my experience. In my case, when I was diagnosed with Diabetes at the age of 10, I was treated poorly from my peers at school. I was all of a sudden someone too fragile to play with. I became a loner over night. It was in these moments that gaming saved my life so to speak. It took me to another world where I can be anything I wanted and helped me cope with my own inner demons.</p>

            <h3>Content Creating</h3>
            <p>In my time of gaming I have grown a liking to content creating. What I mean, is creating youtube videos and also streaming on Twitch. I do it mainly because I like the process of making content and then editing and putting it out for the world to see. There have been a lot of influential streamers in my life, where they motivate you to do good in life not just for entertainment value.</p>
            <p>I hope to be able to get a small following that I can inspire and motivate to tackle life and get a piece of their own success. We have a lot of negativity in this world, there needs to be a balance. I believe we are all capable of greatness and achievement. It takes a lot of hard work but the payoff is amazing.</p>
